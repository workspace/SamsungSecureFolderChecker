# Introduction
I suspected that additional information might be included in the intent used to launch the app. Through debugging, I discovered that a bundle named `activity_options` is passed as this additional information.

While investigating the values in this bundle, I found that the key `android:activity.packageName` contains the value `com.samsung.knox.securefolder`.

```kotlin
// Activity
val packageName = intent.getBundleExtra("activity_options")
  ?.getString("android:activity.packageName", "empty")
  ?: "empty"
```

# Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is a fact discovered through reverse engineering, and it may not function correctly following future updates to Secure Folder.
